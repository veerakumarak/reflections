Q1. - When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?
A1. - During collaboration with other users and for sharing
my awesome projects with the world.

Q2. - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
A2. - Just like i want to make my commits manually and push
them to GitHub manually having made logical changes, i'd like
to pull changes from GitHub to my local repo manually so i
know exactly what am incorporating into my local repo.

Q3. - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3. - forks are cpoies of a repo remotely, clones are
copies of a repo both locally & remotely and braches are
copies of the master branch to a certain period in time.

Q4. - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last
known state of the remote stored locally?
A4. - This provides changes others have pushed to the
remote that are not yet present in my local repo, this
way i can compare the two.

Q5. - How would you collaborate without using Git or 
GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5. - Well, at this point, am thinking everything will
be harder without Git and GitHub.I'd have to use things
like dropbox,google docs, arghhh...

Q6. - When would you want to make changes in a separate
branch rather than directly in master? What benefits
does each approach have?
A6. - I'll do this when i have a fully working master
branch that i do not want to break, so i make a new
branch to experiment on new features.
